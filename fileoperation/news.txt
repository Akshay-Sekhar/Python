So, it has been a brilliant comeback for Bumrah
after almost a year-long injury layoff
To get a Man of the Match award on his return game would be a dream come true for him
The inswinger he bowled to outfox Balbirnie was a beauty â€“ just goes on to show that he has practiced hard in the nets
he has got his rhythm in place
